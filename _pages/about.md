## OptFrame

**OptFrame** is an optimization framework focused project, in which researchers generalizes concepts related to **metaheuristics** and **mathematical programming models**. In particular, the resolution of **NP-Hard** problems if within the scope of this projects.

## Special thanks for SourceForge.net

The **OptFrame** project was hosted in **SourceForge.net** for 8 years and we are very grateful for all support during this time. Thanks to this support, we have published several academic papers and solved many large scale problems during these years. In order to easily interact with new project collaborators the project is now moved to GitHub platform.
